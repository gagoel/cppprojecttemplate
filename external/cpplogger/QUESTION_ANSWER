Q1. What will happen when we will run below code.

LogManager::Init(appname, conffile);
Logger& logger = LogManager::GetLogger(compname);
logger(ERROR) << "Error message";

LogManager::Init(appname1, conffile1);
logger(INFO) << "INFO message";

LogManager::CleanUp();

Ans.
Second LogManager Init call does not do anything 
here. To make second call of Init or need to 
change in Init, you first need to call CleanUp
method.
